# twitter-weather-bot
This is a twitter bot that can tweet daily weather of Atlanta. We used a free, trustworthy online API key for the access of weather data. Then we used JSON to retrieve the data from an object provided by the API. Within every tweet, there is a #Atl and #AtlWeather in order to engage those who live in Atlanta to increase visibility of our TweetBot. Here is a pdf of our project description.The source code for my medium article [How to build a twitter weather bot with Node.js](https://medium.com/@mehdichekori/how-to-build-a-twitter-weather-bot-with-node-js-4560eca55538)
